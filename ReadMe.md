# Discord SoundBoard bot

This is a self-hosting bot which can play any mp3 file you put into the sounds folder


## configuration 
you can configure the bot in the .env file. You only really need to change the bot token and prefix, you can leave the rest unchanged.

you also need to download Node.js v12.0.0 or newer and FFMPEG otherwise the bot wont be able to play sounds through the voice channel.

## commands

to play a sound simply type \<prefix>\<name of the sound file with the .mp3>  
so for example if the prefix is '!' and the mp3 file's name is honk.mp3 then simply type  
```
!honk
```
you can list the all the available sounds with:
```
!list
```
also you can just play a random sound from the available sounds with:
```
!random
```
